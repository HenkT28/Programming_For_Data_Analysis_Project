## Problem statement

For this project I created a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of my choosing. I could pick any phenomenon I wished – you can pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.

It was suggested to use the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Specifically, in this project you should:
• Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.

• Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.

• Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.

• Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.

Note that this project is about simulation – you must synthesise a data set. Some students may already have some real-world data sets in their own files. It is okay to base your synthesised data set on these should you wish (please reference it if you do), but the main task in this project is to create a synthesised data set.
